       " u\"A - hazy (perhaps slightly from bottle conditioning) golden color with a decent head that leaves a nice lacing  S - strong fruity esters with sweet malt and no hop noticeable  T - complex fruity ester flavor from start to finish; sweet malt with no hops detectable - finishes very sweet; perfumy alcohol noticed on finish, but not really enough to dry out the strong malt sweetness  M - medium body, moderately high carbonation  D - I picked up this bottle in a great beer store in Lexington on a recent summer trip. I've always liked stopping at BBC in Louisville and it appears there starting to bottle special editions so I thought I'd give it a try. This tripel is definitely closer to the abbey version than the trappist versions as it finishes quite sweet. The esters really overpower and spicy phenols also. But what it lacks in phenols it somewhat makes up for in ester complexity - to a degree. It could use a bit more hop as it borders on cloying. And in that respect it almost seems like a not-so-clean strong golden ale (strong sweetness & esters). I don't regret having picked it up, but probably won't be purchasing this one again. It was good enough thought that I would consider purchasing another special from BBC.  \",\n",

      "1.0 Poured from a silver foil wrapped bomber into a snifter  A- pours a dark mahogany, one finger dark tan head emerges and quickly dissipates down to a ring, very nice lacing clinging in a nice ring around the glass  S- dark chocolate hits the nose first, followed immediately by the smell of roasted coffee, mixed in is a hint of vanilla that makes it smell like coffee mixed with cream, a little woodiness from the oak, not too much of a bourbon smell which kind of disappoints me  T- dark roasted malt hits the palate immediately, dark bitter chocolate follows and fades into a taste of black coffee, there is a slight twinge of bourbon but not enough considering the style, the oak flavors come through in the aftertaste, really was hoping for more bourbon flavor  M- medium body which is appropriate considering the abv, creamy and smooth, nice balance of carbonation, slight alcohol burn  D- fairly easy to drink, the flavor comes out more as it warms, i personally think this is better than the original HBCS, i think BBC should try this again and try to incorporate more of a bourbon flavor, solid stout though  \n",
      "1.0 Beer pours a bright clear red color with a nice big head. Good looking beer.  Aromas are a bit sweet, tea like, and with a slightly fruity smell.  The flavors really follow the aromas, there is a very fruity tea like quality to this one. There is an all around tart, crisp and dry quality to this beer. It is also a bit sour as well. Not quite what I expect from an IPA, but it's still an interesting and enjoyable beer.  Mouthfeel is pretty good, this is a rounded and full bodied beer.  All in all, this is a drinkable beer. It's not really what I like in an IPA, but it's still tasty and interesting. I'd have no problem drinking another.  This bottle came to me from nlmartin in the secret bunny 07. Thanks!  \n",
      "1.0 I'll hitch a good ride on this wagon. For all of us who have always tried a disapointing brew from this brewery - but have always kept an open mind and grabbed one of their new releases - despite the amount of times we've sucked one down and just wished they could get it right.  This is like a 'where were you?' when John got shot, when Martha went up the creek, When Joe touched them all...  I was in the bath, when I finally got to say...ah!..good work folks!  I poured this one into a tall glass quick and hard like a high school boy. I was used to it pouring like apple juice where head was still an anatomy term. Whoa Daddy! Said the boy when he went too quick too hard - A head rose at the last 1/4\" inch of the glass and continued to form from the bottom up, not spilling over.  Deep mahogany bourban colouring with a quickly fading head, however like the apple juice - no lacing.  Aromas of dark grapes, floral with hints of sharp spices.  This tastes delicious - hints of caramel, pears with a lemony tart cidery finish. Nice pinch from the hops - they really come through as the the chewy malts keep this one tied together.  Mouthfeel, is tart and like a low abv multi dark fruit wine.  Drinkablilty - I'll highly reccomend this to my pal, and it'll be a staple in our fridges until its gone. Nice sipper for dinner as well.  Man am I excited about Trafalgar now - great work folks!  \n",
      "1.0 Clear light amber color with an ecru head and a little lace. Aroma is toasted wheat bread with some nuttiness and diacetyl. Flavor is not much different except for vague notes of caramel, iced tea, and metal. Thin and watery mouthfeel, drinkable but not very good. Not exactly a big surprise.  \n",
      "1.0 22oz bottle poured into my favorite pint glass.  A- Dark amber color typical of many of the fine northwest craft beers. Robust head which dissipates into a thin topping on the core of the beer. Excellent lacing covers the entire area of my pint glass.   S - Roasted malt, hint of chocolate, sweet hop smell in the air. Spicy aroma is present.  T- Nice malty roasted taste with hints of chocolate and a spicy hopped finish. Very complex but tasty.  M- Light carbonation with a smooth dry finish. Medium bodied beer.  D- Nice drinkable beer which is spicy and filling. This would be a great after dinner beer.  Overall, I like it!  \n",
      "1.0 Video review at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2alroWjKzP8  Appearance: Ruby red w/ hop sediment, 4-finger head sticks around, average lacing  Smell: Fresh pine needles, orange citrus, caramel + bready malts, juniper, grassiness, toffee, raspberry jam, super balanced  Taste: Medium body, meyer lemon, bready malts, doughy bread, white grapiness, caramelized pecan, spruce, hint of juniper, rye + pumpernickel residual, hint of raspberry on finish, lively carbonation  Pairings: Pad Thai  Brew + pairing: Sweet + saltiness plays nicely with this slightly bitter, yet balanced brew  \n",
      "1.0 Pours from a 22oz bottle into a large snifter a pitch black color (or lack thereof) with a somewhat fizzy type, bourbon colored head with a touch of lacing. The head receded rather abruptly and remains a swirling, Kharybdis-like whirlpool in the middle with some foamy rings around the edges.   Aroma is very very nice. Loads of bourbon without being too bourbony. A great deal of vanilla as well. Oaky woodiness appears as well as the large bit of roastiness. Slight bit of raw cocoa and some raisin like qualities as well.   Super solid flavor. Great bourbon and vanilla flavors balance and compliment each other very nicely. A hefty dose of hop bitterness keeps the sweetness in check on this one. Chocolate and coffee are less evident in the flavor as the bourbon and oakiness seem to be the star here.  A little light bodied and somewhat fizzy for the style. Coats the tongue and teeth nicely, though. This is one great beer and is very easy to drink. Drinks like a 6% beer, and that is dangerous.  Thanks a bunch to ncsincere for this beauty.  \n",
      "1.0 The weiss had a decent hazy yellow appearance with a nice white head. Smell was ok. Cloves and banana notes, but no real malt presence.   Taste was acceptable, but nothing to jump up and down about. It did go very well with the fresh oysters, so thats a plus. Some spic/clove notes but the banana taste was a little too estery for me. Some malt crept in to try and modulate the taste.   Mouthfeel was slightly thin, drinkability was slighlty above average.  \n",
      "1.0 22oz bottle poured into a pint glass A: Such a dark brown brown it's almost black, with a tan one-finger head that reduces to a thin covering. S: It certainly does smell silky, with aromas of creamy chocolate and caff latte. T: Again chocolate and coffee, but tastes watered down. M: Very thin given the aromas/style. O: This tastes like a 'light' porter, should such a thing shamefully exist. The aromas are very nice, the flavors are there but it's just thin.  \n",
      "1.0 A: Black with a very thin brown head that fades real quick to noghintg.  S: Great unique aroma. Very rich. Coffee but mostly chocolate, but heavy vanilla with some cherries, plum and raisins.. Very sweet. Booziness creeps in with an oakiness and roasted malts.  T/M: Really smooth and heavy. Very little carbonation which works in this very rich beer. Starts off all chocolate for a while, developing into roasted malt, vanilla then comes in and mixes with cherries and rasins. Finsish is smoky and oaky and looong with the hop spiciness coming to the front. Big and fat and chewy though the slightest bit hot.  D: This is a huge fat and chewy beer meant to be sipped.  Ovr: I've been drinking a lot of oatmeal stouts recently, Devil Over a Barrel, and KBS, and this is right up there with all of those. Definitely heavier than all of them, and more full bodied. Great great great beer.  \n",
      "1.0 2009 batch 3 version (thanks to jwjon1 for sending this one), poured into a Saint Arnolds sniffer, we did a side by side comparison with the Crusher version.  Appearance: Black with a thick mocha head about a finger thick, which quickly receded into a thin ring around the side of the glass.   Aroma: Coffee, chocolate, roasted grain, vanilla, and bourbon. I preferred the aroma in this version much more. The bourbon barrel aging added the extra complexity that the other version was missing.   Taste: Chocolate, coffee, bourbon, and alcohol. The flavors were kind of messy and a little bland, this might have been due to the aging.  Mouthfeel: Lighter body and mouth feel then its non-BA brother with medium carbonation.  Overall: I preferred the non-BA version to the BA version. The enjoyed the aroma of the BA version more but the flavor and the mouthfeel of the non-BA version was better in my opinion.  \n",
      "1.0 Pours a copper orange with a white cream head that fades rather quickly. The smell is of roasted malts and grilled fruit, alcohol lingers. The taste is very light for this style, roasted malts and fruit blend well with the alcohol tones, hopyp dryness bring up the rear. A drinkable Scotch Ale but lighter than most, I like Scotch Ales with a cigar but this one just doesn't quite make it to the cigar room.  \n",
      "1.0 2011 vintage  A-Pours out a nearly translucent copper/amber body with about an inch and a half of bone white foam that showed moderate retention and left decent stringy lacing.  S-Really nice nose.Meaty roasted pumpkin,allspice,cinnamon candies,clove,brown sugar and caramel.Spices were complementary and not forced or overdone.  T-Once again there was a natural,roasted pumpkin flavor,vanilla,cinnamon,ginger and nutmeg with a nice toffee malt backbone.  M-Medium bodied with appropriate spice and fall flavors.This is a really good example of the style.It had a subtle creaminess that I think could have been accentuated and might have brought about an almost pumpkin pie ala mode touch.  O-Extremely solid and tasty pumpkin ale.Second best I've tasted behind Schlafly.  \n",
      "0.0 I had heard about the Maple Bock in an article and was intrigued by the idea of adding maple syrup post-fermentation to add a more prominent maple flavour. I wish I had checked this site first, then maybe I would have gone for something more worth my money.  Appearance - its pour made me think of an oily Coca-Cola... dark brown, fizzy, with a light brown head that disappeared in less than a minute. So far, not too impressed. It must be the syrup. Remained cloudy long after the bubbles disappeared.   Smell - Smells like Lake Ontario at its worst. No floral or fruity notes, no hops, at all. I can't even smell any Maple.  Taste - A little better than it smelled... a sour-sweetness overshadows the hops, it's got to be the maple syrup again, this is not working at all like I thought it would. The aftertaste is not so good, my throat is full of some sort of goo, as if I've just puked. It also tastes like something's wrong with the water. I tried Trafalgar's Celtic Ale a while back and I thought the weird taste was a one-off but this is discouraging, I don't know if I want to buy anything from these guys again.  Mouthfeel - it feels exactly like you'd think maple syrup mixed with beer would... I don't know what else to say, it's interesting but the other factors are just turning me right off this beer.  Drinkability - I wouldn't unless you want to try it for yourself, maybe you'll like it. I don't really. I'm 5 sips into this stuff and it's hard to go any further. Overall really disappointing.  \n",
      "1.0 Poured into weizen glass: Pours clouded golden amber with a foamy white head that becomes rocky and stays. Patchy lacing sticks.  The smell is of clove and floral notes - some wheat tang - little to no banana.  The taste is malty - caramelish - a light spicy, floral dryness balances it out in the finish. It has some toasted wheat, but little to no banana. I like the taste, though it is more of a better American Wheat than true HW.  It has an effervescent, light, smooth - somewhat creamy - body. Crisp.  A nice \"thirst-quencher\". More of an American Pale Wheat with a touch of caramel than a hefeweizen. On the label it claims to be an \"American version\" and it doesn't do bad at all as an American Wheat with a touch of clove. Well-worth the value for a refreshing brew!  \n"
